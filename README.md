# CPDD
Contrastive Prototype Dataset Distillation

## Walkthrough
You can find here a description of the structure of the project.

## First steps
_Recommanded:_ use a Python virtual environment. To set up the environment, use the next commands:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
The first command will create a folder `venv` which contains the environment files. The second line activates the virtual environment (execute this one each time you reopen the project). The third line installs the package dependencies. To exit the virtual environment, use the `deactivate` command.
